MochaRequireJSHandlebarsFixtures
================================

Mocha + RequireJS + Handlebars for fixtures

Basic boilerplate with silly scripts/tests that you would never use, but gets
the idea across.

Also uses bower for package management (but packages are checked in here so no
need to use it if you don't want to).
